<p>Bridget is an edu-wonk who reads long biographies of former presidents, trains for triathlons, and enjoys visiting a new national park each year.</p>

<p>Steve is a librarian-turned-programmer who plays tuba in the <a href="http://gogosymphony.com">Go-Go Symphony</a>, a local DC band, serves as a key member of a top-ranked trivia team, and keeps tabs on all the latest fun events happening in DC.</p>

<p>Even though Steve played soccer every week only a block from Bridget’s apartment, they met in the modern way: online. They initially bonded over their shared interest in exploring local trails by bike. Steve picked <a href="http://meridianpint.com/">Meridian Pint</a>&mdash;a bar Bridget has always enjoyed&mdash;for their very first date.</p>

<p>They soon realized that while they are both awesome individually, together they are <a href="http://www.awesomesaucewedding.com/">awesome sauce</a>. (They also discovered a shared interest in the TV show <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em>.)</p>

<p>Since they met, they have embarked on numerous adventures, including many explorations of DC historic sites and parks on foot and by bike, camping trips, brewery tours, visits to family, and an amazing trip to Glacier National Park, where they saw bighorn sheep, mountain goats, bears (from a safe distance), and moose (up close, since one charged at the hiking group!). They also can now be seen in DC and elsewhere wearing matching DC hats, which makes them both great advocates for DC statehood and the cutest couple you have ever seen.</p>

<p>Steve and Bridget are looking forward to many more adventures, in DC and beyond. Aside from their long list of cool things to check out in DC, they have a few other pet projects: Steve has still not convinced Bridget that it’s worth it to read <em>Infinite Jest</em>, and Bridget has a long list of classic movies that will take years to screen with Steve. They are excited to celebrate their marriage with you on this special day, but also in the years to come.</p>
