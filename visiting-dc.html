<h2>Getting here</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="small-6 columns">
    <h4>Reagan National Airport (DCA)</h4>
    <p>The closest and most convenient airport.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="small-6 columns">
   <h4> Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD)</h4>
    <p>Not quite so close or convenient, but they do have buses, shuttles, and cabs.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="small-6 columns">
    <h4>Baltimore Washington International Airport (BWI)</h4>
    <p>Also not so close or convenient, but they also have buses, and shuttles; maybe skip the cab.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="small-6 columns">
    <h4>Amtrak - Union Station</h4>
    <p>For East Coasters, Amtrak is another excellent option. The train gets into Union Station, which also has the Metro (red line) or is a short 15-20 minute cab ride to the wedding hotels.</p>
  </div>
</div>


<h2>Getting around</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>Metro</dt>
  <dd>The local public transportation department here, they have trains and buses (and street cars). SmarTrip cards, which are used to pay the fare, can be purchased at any metro station. We recommend using public transportation while youâ€™re here to get around town.</dd>

  <dt>Uber/Taxi</dt>
  <dd>Since the ceremony, reception, and hotels are all so close to each other, taxis or Uber&mdash;an alternative to taxis&mdash;can be a good way to travel. Take UberX or Uber (not Uber Taxi) and get a free ride using the code &ldquo;bridgetk20&rdquo;.</dd>

  <dt>Parking garages</dt>
  <dd>Both of the wedding block hotels have parking garages. If you would like to drive to the ceremony, we advise that you park in the DC USA parking garage. Street parking is very limited. The entrance is on Park Road NW between 14th and 16th Streets NW. Once the car is parked, follow signs in the garage to the Irving Street Lobby to exit and walk the two blocks to the church&mdash;right on Irving Street NW, and then right on 16th Street NW.</dd>

<h2>While you&rsquo;re here</h2>

<p>Bridget and Steve are big fans of DC and all that it has to offer. Here are some suggestions for your time here. If you need more ideas, don&rsqquo;t hesitate to reach out!  We love to share ways to explore our city.</p>


<h3>For families and the young at heart</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/">National Zoo</a>: Check out the adorable baby pandas and other animals.  Also, it&rsquo;s totally free (if you take public transit and don&rsqquo;t park there.)</li>
  <li><a href="http://nmai.si.edu/visit/washington/imaginations/">imagiNATIONS Activity Center</a>, National Museum of the American Indian: Lots of great activities for kids.  Also free.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.nbm.org/">The National Building Museum</a>: Often has unique, hands-on offerings for kids; exhibits change frequently.</li>
  <li>Local playgrounds: Kalorama Park and Mitchell Park park come highly recommended by Bridget&rsquo;s niece (and her parents).</li>
</ul>


 <h3>For those looking to live like a local</h3>

 <ul>
  <li>Meridian Pint: The bar where Bridget and Steve had their first date. Make your own beer sampler and try the pulled pork sandwich.</li>
  <li>Glen&rsquo;s Garden Market: Great for sandwiches on the go and a local beer or two on the patio, if it&rsquo;s not too crowded.</li>
  <li>Right Proper: Local beer and tasty food in the heart of the Shaw neighborhood.</li>
  <li>Heurich House: The former home of DC&rsquo;s most famous brewer. Fun fact: his brewery once stood where the Kennedy Center now is. Tours offered on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.</li>
  <li>Woodrow Wilson House: President Wilson is the only President in recent memory who decided to stay in DC after his time in office. The home and grounds are beautiful and you can learn a lot about a fascinating era in history. Guided tours from Wednesday to Sunday.</li>
  <li>Dupont Kalorama Museums Consortium: is hosting a <a href="http://dupontkaloramamc.com/walk-weekend-2015/">free museum walk</a> the weekend of our wedding.</li>
</ul>


<h3>For those looking to explore the great outdoors</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Self-guided monument tour: Get a Capital Bikeshare bike and explore the monuments. Be sure to check out the Jefferson Memorial (Steve&rsquo;s favorite) and the Lincoln Memorial (Bridget&rsquo;s favorite). Or take a guided version by signing up for a Segway tour.</li>
  <li>Hains Point / Gravelly Point: Also using a Bikeshare bike, check out Hains Point Park and/or ride out along the Mount Vernon trail to watch the planes land at Gravelly Point.</li>
  <li>Georgetown Waterfront: Rent a kayak at the Key Bridge Boathouse to get a view of DC from the Potomac. Afterward, get a snack of macarons at Malmaison nearby.</li>
   <li>Dumbarton Oaks: The gardens here are amazingly beautiful and well worth the $10 admission fee. If you&rsquo;re interested in some history&mdash;or air conditioning&mdash;after the gardens, check out the free museum.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Dining near the wedding hotels</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Shake Shack: Amazing milkshakes and burgers.</li>
  <li>Churchkey: Vast selection of beers on tap and solid food.  Nicer restaurant downstairs.</li>
  <li>Teakwood: Good Thai food and sushi and a laid-back atmosphere</li>
  <li>Dolcezza: Delicious gelato, plus coffee drinks.</li>
</ul>
