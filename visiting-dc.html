<h2>Getting here</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="small-6 columns">
    <h4>Reagan National Airport (DCA)</h4>
    <p>The closest and most convenient airport.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="small-6 columns">
   <h4> Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD)</h4>
    <p>Not quite so close or convenient, but they do have buses, shuttles, and cabs.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="small-6 columns">
    <h4>Baltimore Washington International Airport (BWI)</h4>
    <p>Also not so close or convenient, but they also have buses, and shuttles; maybe skip the cab.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="small-6 columns">
    <h4>Amtrak - Union Station</h4>
    <p>For East Coasters, Amtrak is another excellent option. The train gets into Union Station, which also has the Metro (red line) or is a short 15-20 minute cab ride to the wedding hotels.</p>

<h2>While you&rsquo;re here</h2>

<p>Bridget and Steve are big fans of DC and all that it has to offer. Here are some suggestions for your time here. If you need more ideas, don&rsqquo;t hesitate to reach out!  We love to share ways to explore our city.</p>


<h3>For families and the young at heart</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The National Zoo: Check out the adorable baby pandas and other animals.  Also, it&rsquo;s totally free (if you take public transit and don&rsqquo;t park there.)</li>
  <li>imagiNATIONS Activity Center, National Museum of the American Indian: Lots of great activities for kids.  Also free.</li>
  <li>The National Building Museum: Often has unique, hands-on offerings for kids; exhibits change frequently.</li>
  <li>Local playgrounds: Kalorama Park and Mitchell Park park come highly recommended by Bridget&rsquo;s niece (and her parents).</li>
</ul>


 <h3>For those looking to live like a local</h3>

 <ul>
  <li>Meridian Pint: The bar where Bridget and Steve had their first date. Make your own beer sampler and try the pulled pork sandwich.</li>
  <li>Glen&rsquo;s Garden Market: Great for sandwiches on the go and a local beer or two on the patio, if it&rsquo;s not too crowded.</li>
  <li>Right Proper: Local beer and tasty food in the heart of the Shaw neighborhood.</li>
  <li>Heurich House: The former home of DC&rsquo;s most famous brewer. Fun fact: his brewery once stood where the Kennedy Center now is. Tours offered on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.</li>
  <li>Woodrow Wilson House: President Wilson is the only President in recent memory who decided to stay in DC after his time in office. The home and grounds are beautiful and you can learn a lot about a fascinating era in history. Guided tours from Wednesday to Sunday.</li>
</ul>


<h3>For those looking to explore the great outdoors</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Self-guided monument tour: Get a Capital Bikeshare bike and explore the monuments. Be sure to check out the Jefferson Memorial (Steve&rsquo;s favorite) and the Lincoln Memorial (Bridget&rsquo;s favorite). Or take a guided version by signing up for a Segway tour.</li>
  <li>Hains Point / Gravelly Point: Also using a Bikeshare bike, check out Hains Point Park and/or ride out along the Mount Vernon trail to watch the planes land at Gravelly Point.</li>
  <li>Georgetown Waterfront: Rent a kayak at the Key Bridge Boathouse to get a view of DC from the Potomac. Afterward, get a snack of macarons at Malmaison nearby.</li>
   <li>Dumbarton Oaks: The gardens here are amazingly beautiful and well worth the $10 admission fee. If you&rsquo;re interested in some history&mdash;or air conditioning&mdash;after the gardens, check out the free museum.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Dining near the wedding hotels</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Mandu</li>
  <li>Bar Charley</li>
  <li>Agora</li>
  <li>Shake Shack: Amazing milkshakes and burgers.</li>
  <li>Churchkey: Vast selection of beers on tap and solid food.  Nicer restaurant downstairs.</li>
  <li>Teakwood: Good Thai food and sushi and a laid-back atmosphere</li>
  <li>Dolcezza: Delicious gelato, plus coffee drinks.</li>
</ul>
