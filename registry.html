  <li><a href="http://becaschools.org/donate">BECA</a> is a nonprofit that  recruits, trains, and supports English-speaking volunteer teachers to staff a network of community-run bilingual schools in Honduras that serve low-income communities. Bridget served as a middle school teacher at one of the schools in 2006-2007 and believes that a quality education can play a crucial role in helping students achieve their dreams.</li>

Steve has played here numerous times with his band the <a href="http://gogosymphony.com">go-go symphony</a>. It&rsquo;s a great community-focused arts organization.</li>
